## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24.1+**
- **PostgreSQL 17+**
- **Discord Bot Token** ([Create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skufu/LockIn-Bot.git
   cd LockIn-Bot
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Install goose for migrations (if not already installed)
   go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
   
   # Run migrations
   goose -dir db/migrations postgres "your_database_url" up
   ```

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   go build -o lockin-bot ./main.go
   ./lockin-bot
   ```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t lockin-bot .
docker run --env-file .env lockin-bot
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Discord Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID=your_logging_channel_id
STREAK_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID=your_streak_channel_id

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=lockinbot

# Voice Channel Tracking
ALLOWED_VOICE_CHANNEL_IDS=channel1,channel2,channel3
```

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application and bot
3. Copy the bot token to your `.env` file
4. Invite the bot to your server with the following permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Read Message History
   - Connect to Voice Channels
   - View Channels

### Voice Channel Configuration

Add the Discord channel IDs of voice channels you want to track to `ALLOWED_VOICE_CHANNEL_IDS` as a comma-separated list. Users joining these channels will have their study time automatically tracked.

## 🎮 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/stats` | Display your personal study statistics and rankings |
| `/leaderboard` | Show the server-wide study time leaderboard |
| `/streak` | Check your current study streak and progress |
| `/help` | Display available commands and bot information |

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with **Clean Architecture** principles:

- **External Layer**: Discord command handlers and event processors
- **Application Layer**: Use case orchestration and input validation
- **Business Layer**: Core business logic and domain rules (streak calculations, statistics)
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database operations with SQLC for type-safe queries

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.24.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with SQLC for type-safe queries
- **Discord API**: discordgo library
- **Deployment**: Docker + Render
- **Timezone Handling**: Asia/Manila timezone for consistent streak calculations
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with dependency injection

## 🔄 Scheduled Operations

The bot runs several automated tasks:

- **11:59 PM Manila**: Daily streak evaluation and flag reset processing
- **8:00 PM Manila**: Evening activity warnings for users at risk of losing streaks
- **Midnight UTC**: Statistics resets (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **3:05 AM UTC**: Data pruning (removes old session records)

### Streak System Details

- **Minimum Activity**: 1 minute of voice channel activity per day
- **Calendar Day Basis**: Streaks are calculated based on Manila timezone calendar days
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant notifications when completing daily activity
- **Double-increment Protection**: Built-in safeguards prevent streak counting errors
- **Automatic Evaluation**: End-of-day processing ensures accurate streak maintenance

## Discord Token Management

### When Your Token Expires

Discord bot tokens can expire or become invalid when:
- Token is manually regenerated in Discord Developer Portal
- Discord detects security issues and force-regenerates
- Token is manually revoked

### Automatic Detection & Alerts

LockIn-Bot includes built-in token monitoring that:
- ✅ Checks Discord connection health every 30 seconds
- 🚨 Detects token expiration automatically
- 📢 Sends alerts to your logging channel
- 📋 Provides clear instructions in logs
- 🔄 Gracefully shuts down for restart

### What To Do When Token Expires

**The bot will automatically detect expiration and show these instructions:**

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal:** https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **Select your bot application**
3. **Navigate to 'Bot' section**
4. **Click 'Reset Token'** to generate a new token
5. **Copy the new token**
6. **Update your environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # In your .env file or deployment environment
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
   ```
7. **Restart the bot service:**
   ```bash
   # If using Docker/Render
   # The service will restart automatically due to exit code
   
   # If running locally
   go run main.go
   ```

### Preventive Measures

- **Monitor Logs:** Watch for "🚨 CRITICAL" alerts
- **Set Up Notifications:** Configure alerts for your logging channel
- **Document Token Location:** Keep track of where tokens are stored
- **Backup Plan:** Have deployment restart procedures ready

### Token Security Best Practices

- ✅ Store tokens in environment variables, never in code
- ✅ Use `.env` files for local development  
- ✅ Keep tokens secure in production environments
- ❌ Never commit tokens to version control
- ❌ Don't share tokens in messages or public channels

**Happy studying! 📚✨**
